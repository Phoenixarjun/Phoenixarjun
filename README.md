# Hi, I’m Naresh B A 👋  
**Software Engineer | Building AI & ML Systems on Strong Backend Foundations**

I’m a Software Engineer focused on building **AI- and ML-driven systems** backed by solid backend engineering and system design principles.

I care less about demos that “look smart” and more about systems that:
- scale under load
- fail predictably
- are explainable and maintainable
- translate ML ideas into real products

---

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On

- **AI & ML Systems** — RAG pipelines, agent workflows, evaluation, safety
- **Backend Engineering** — APIs, data flow, reliability, performance
- **System Design** — tradeoffs, failure modes, scalability
- **Learning in Public** — documenting *what actually works*

## ✍️ Technical Writing

I write to **clarify thinking**, not chase trends.

Recent deep dives:
- Shallow vs Deep Agents & how research systems actually work  
- Guardrails for AI coding agents  
- Modern RAG architectures beyond “vanilla RAG”
